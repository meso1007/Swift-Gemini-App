Trial version implementation planned for the future
Thoughts on the Service
I am currently a student, and I frequently use GPT for various purposes. However, due to financial constraints, I am unable to subscribe to GPT-4, leading to instances where I do not receive the optimal responses. In such situations, upon learning about Google Gemini AI, which provides responses equivalent to GPT-4 for free, I decided to develop a Japanese Gemini app.

How to Use
1. Launch the app.
2. Pose a question to the AI.
3. Receive the response.
Future Prospects
This time, I experimented with using generative AI, resulting in a rather simple product. In the future, I plan to develop interactive AI apps using Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text functionalities.
